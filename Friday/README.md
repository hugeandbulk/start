Scrum and Kanban

### Scrum
Scrum is a management framework that teams use to self-organize and work towards a common goal. It describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles for efficient project delivery. Much like a sports team practicing for a big match, Scrum practices allow teams to self-manage, learn from experience, and adapt to change.

Scrum is an agile project management system commonly used in software development, although it is also used in other fields including research, sales, marketing, education, and advanced technologies.

Scrum helps people and teams deliver value incrementally in a collaborative way. As an agile framework, Scrum provides just enough structure for people and teams to integrate into how they work, while adding the right practices to optimize for their specific needs.

Scrum is a process framework used to manage product development and other knowledge work.


Use Kanban boards to visualize your entire project from start to finish. Track everything from sprint planning to feedback loops and launch datesâ€”all in one workflow.
