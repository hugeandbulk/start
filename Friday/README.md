(Why Friday is called Friday?

Naming Friday

The English name Friday is derived from Old English and means “day of Frigg,” the Norse goddess of fertility and love, who is often perceived as the same deity as Freya.)

### Scrum
Scrum is a management framework that teams use to self-organize and work towards a common goal. It describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles for efficient project delivery. Much like a sports team practicing for a big match, Scrum practices allow teams to self-manage, learn from experience, and adapt to change.

Scrum is an agile project management system commonly used in software development, although it is also used in other fields including research, sales, marketing, education, and advanced technologies.

Scrum helps people and teams deliver value incrementally in a collaborative way. As an agile framework, Scrum provides just enough structure for people and teams to integrate into how they work, while adding the right practices to optimize for their specific needs.

Scrum is a process framework used to manage product development and other knowledge work.

### Kanban
Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

Kanban is a workflow management method that helps organizations manage and improve work systems. Learn how to visualize work and improve efficiency with Kanban.

Kanban is a popular Lean workflow management method for defining, managing, and improving services that deliver knowledge work. It helps you visualize work, maximize efficiency, and improve continuously. Work is represented on Kanban boards, allowing you to optimize work delivery across multiple teams and handle even the most complex projects in a single environment.

Use Kanban boards to visualize your entire project from start to finish. Track everything from sprint planning to feedback loops and launch dates—all in one workflow.
