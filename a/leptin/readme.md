### Leptin
Leptin is a hormone derived from adipose tissue and the small intestine, mainly in enterocytes; it helps regulate the energy balance by suppressing hunger, resulting in decreased fat mass in adipocytes. Leptin is a cytokine of the long-chain helical cytokine family, containing interleukin-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and growth hormone. It is coded for by the obese (OB or LEP) gene which is on chromosome 7q31. 3, and which comprises three exons and two introns.

What is the function of leptin?

Leptin helps inhibit (prevent) hunger and regulate energy balance so that your body doesn't trigger a hunger response when it doesn't need energy (calories). Leptin mainly acts on your brainstem and hypothalamus to regulate hunger and energy balance, though you have leptin receptors in other areas of your body.

What is leptin secreted by?

Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipocytes that plays an important role in food intake, energy expenditure, reproduction, glucose metabolism, and fat metabolism.

Is leptin a fat burning hormone?

Leptin is a hormone that tells the brain when enough fat is stored, preventing overeating and aiding in healthy calorie burning. Leptin resistance can cause the brain to miss this signal, which may contribute to obesity.

What hormone produces leptin?

Leptin is a peptide hormone synthesized by white adipose tissue. The leptin gene (LEP or ob) is on chromosome 7q31.3.The mature protein is comprised of 146 amino acids and produced through mRNA-directed protein synthesis.

What is another name for leptin?

Leptin sends a signal to your brain that helps you feel full and less interested in food. You may hear it called a satiety hormone. (Satiety means hunger feels satisfied).

Is leptin full or hungry?

Leptin decreases your appetite, while ghrelin increases it. Ghrelin is made in your stomach and signals your brain when you're hungry. Your fat cells produce leptin. Leptin lets your brain know when you have enough energy stored and feel “full.”

Is high leptin good or bad?

In some studies, chronically-elevated leptin levels have been associated with obesity, overeating, and inflammation-related diseases, including hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease. However, no cause-and-effect has been established.

What activates leptin?

Insulin is an important factor in the stimulation of leptin secretion. Whether its in vivo activity can be considered acute is controversial. However, insulin regulates the long-term leptin secretion of adipose cells by a transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanism.

What is the gene coding for leptin?

The LEP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called leptin, which is involved in the regulation of body weight. Normally, the body's fat cells release leptin in proportion to their size. As fat accumulates in cells, more leptin is produced.

What is the pathway of the leptin hormone?

Leptin activates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 when it binds to the long isoform of leptin receptor (LepRb) in the arcuate nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus, and other hypothalamic neurons. Activated STAT3 stimulates pomc expression and inhibits agrp expression in the hypothalamus.

What is the leptin coding gene?

The LEP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called leptin, which is involved in the regulation of body weight. Normally, the body's fat cells release leptin in proportion to their size. As fat accumulates in cells, more leptin is produced.

What is leptin chemical formula?

Leptin (93-105) (human) | C64H110N20O23

What is leptin mechanism of action?

The adipose tissue-derived hormone leptin acts via its receptor (LRb) in the brain to regulate energy balance and neuroendocrine function. LRb signaling via STAT3 and a number of other pathways is required for the totality of leptin action.

Who discovered leptin?

Douglas Coleman and Jeffery Friedman shared the 2010 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award for their discovery of a fat cell-produced hormone, leptin (Greek leptos means thin). The discovery was a landmark event in modern physiology.

What inhibits leptin?

Insulin-stimulated leptin secretion could also be inhibited by a series of agents increasing intracellular cAMP levels, such as lipolytic hormones (ACTH and thyrotropin-stimulating hormone), various nonhydrolyzable cAMP analogs, pertussis toxin, forskolin, methylxanthines (caffeine, theophylline, IBMX). 

Is leptin an insulin?

Leptin and insulin share common effects in the control of food intake and energy metabolism. In the blood glucose homeostasis, both play important roles. Leptin and insulin directly regulate each other : 0 leptin inhibits insulin; insulin stimulates leptin synthesis and secretion.
