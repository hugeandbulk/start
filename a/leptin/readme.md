### Leptin
Leptin is a hormone derived from adipose tissue and the small intestine, mainly in enterocytes; it helps regulate the energy balance by suppressing hunger, resulting in decreased fat mass in adipocytes.

Is leptin a fat burning hormone?

Leptin is a hormone that tells the brain when enough fat is stored, preventing overeating and aiding in healthy calorie burning. Leptin resistance can cause the brain to miss this signal, which may contribute to obesity.

What hormone produces leptin?

Leptin is a peptide hormone synthesized by white adipose tissue. The leptin gene (LEP or ob) is on chromosome 7q31. 3. [2] The mature protein is comprised of 146 amino acids and produced through mRNA-directed protein synthesis.
