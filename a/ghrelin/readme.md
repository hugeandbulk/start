### Ghrelin
Ghrelin is a hormone produced by enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract, especially the stomach, and is often called a "hunger hormone" because it increases the drive to eat. Blood levels of ghrelin are highest before meals when hungry, returning to lower levels after mealtimes.

_Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide existing in two major forms: n-octanoyl-modified ghrelin, which possesses an n-octanoyl modification on serine-3 and des-acyl ghrelin. Fatty acid modification of ghrelin is essential for ghrelin-induced growth hormone release from the pituitary and appetite stimulation_.

Ghrelin, the “hunger hormone,” plays a key role because, in addition to its several other important functions, it can signal to your brain that it’s time to eat.

Leptin decreases your appetite, while ghrelin increases it. Ghrelin is made in your stomach and signals your brain when you're hungry. Your fat cells produce leptin. Leptin lets your brain know when you have enough energy stored and feel “full.”

Ghrelin is a hormone that sends a signal to your brain to feel hungry. It plays a key role in regulating calorie intake and body fat levels.

Ghrelin plays a central role in controlling major biological processes. As for other G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) peptide agonists, the structure and dynamics of ghrelin bound to its receptor remain obscure.

regulation. Receptors are also found concentrated in other areas of the brain, including the hippocampus and regions known to be involved in reward systems (e.g. tegmental area); indeed, ghrelin appears to activate some of the same circuits that are involved in drug reward, which may also be related to this hormone's effects on appetite.

Physiologic Effects of Ghrelin and Control of Secretion
At least two major biologic activites have been ascribed to ghrelin:

Stimulation of growth hormone secretion: Ghrelin, as the ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, potently stimulates secretion of growth hormone. The ghrelin signal is integrated with that of growth hormone releasing hormone and somatostatin to control the timing and magnitude of growth hormone secretion.
Regulation of energy balance: In both rodents and humans, ghrelin functions to increase hunger though its action on hypothalamic feeding centers. This makes sense relative to increasing plasma ghrelin concentrations observed during fasting (see below). Additionally, humans injected with ghrelin reported sensations of intense hunger. Ghrelin also appears to suppress fat utilization in adipose tissue, which is somewhat paradoxical considering that growth hormone has the opposite effect. Overall, ghrelin seems to be one of several hormonal signals that communicates the state of energy balance in the body to the brain.
Other effects of ghrelin include stimulating gastric emptying and having a variety of positive effects on cardiovascular function (e.g. increased cardiac output). It is not totally clear whether the cardiovascular effects are a direct effect of ghrelin or represent an indirect effect of ghrelin's ability to stimulate growth hormone secretion.

Given the effects of ghrelin on energy metabolism and hunger, it is a prominent target for development of anti-obesity treatments. It has been reported that immunization of rats against ghrelin resulted in decreased weight gain and adiposity relative control rats, even though both groups consumed an equivalent amount of food. This intriguing experiment suggests the possibility of a vaccine against obesity.

Control of ghrelin secretion remains poorly understood. Other hormones that influence it's secretion include estrogen and leptin, but a comprehensive understanding of, for example, short term control of secretion from the stomach, is lacking.

Disease States
Ghrelin concentrations in blood are reduced in obese humans compared to lean control subjects, but whether this is cause or effect is not defined. Patients with anorexia nervosa have higher than normal plasma ghrelin levels, which decrease if weight gain occurs.

Prader-Willi syndrome is another disorder relevant to ghrelin science. Affected patients develop extreme obesity associated with uncontrollable and voracious appetite. The plasma ghrelin levels are exceptionally high in comparison to patients similarly obese due to other causes. Prader-Willi syndrome is clearly a complex disease with many defects; it may be that excessive ghrelin production contributes to the appetite and obesity components.
