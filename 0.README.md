For IndiGen, the cost per sample came to Rs 1 lakh while 10 years ago, the cost of the first genome that was sequenced in India was Rs 50 lakh. Sivasubbu is optimistic that in two to three years, the cost will drop to below Rs 50,000. In the US, a genome can be sequenced for as low as $200 (Rs 14,000).
