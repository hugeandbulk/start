About

In my work I follow the principle of "minimum unnecessary, maximum meaning", striving to create designs that are clear, concise, and effective in achieving their intended purpose.


For the past three years, design has been my passion, and I've had the privilege of creating websites for clients across a range of fields, including events, PR agencies, photography, education, property agencies, architectural studios, and more. But I'm always eager to take on new challenges and discover new industries.

In addition to my design skills, I have a basic understanding of marketing and copywriting, which allows me to create websites that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also user-friendly and profitable for businesses.
